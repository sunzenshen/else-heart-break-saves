Save Games for Else Heart.Break()
=================================

The game EHB takes a long time to get to the programming tutorials,
so here are some save game files for skipping to that point.

* `HanksApartment - Day 4 - 12#35.json`

Hank, the hotel maintenance guy, has invited you (Seb) to his apartment,
to teach you about how to use your "modifier" to program objects in the game.
Talk to the man in the red bellhop uniform to get started.

* `DorisGardens West - Day 4 - 11#05.json`

Fib, the city gardener, has offered to give you tips on how to program conditionals, such as `if`.
Talk to the man sitting next to you on the bench, to get started.
He may also get up as soon as you load the save.


Where to place these save files for Windows:
============================================

* Find your Steam installation, and then place the .json save files in this folder:

`Steam\steamapps\common\ElseHeartbreak\ElseHeartbreak_Data\Saves`

Where to place these save files in OS X:

```
